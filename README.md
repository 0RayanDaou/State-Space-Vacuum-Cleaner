# State-Space-Vacuum-Cleaner
In this project, we created a vaccuum cleaning agent that finds its path in a room and tries to clean the room in the least number of steps while minimizing energy consumption and maximizing performance. I also worked on implementing a Multi-Agent Adversarial Vacuum Cleaner Agent, where the environment includes a Vacuum Cleaner and a Dirt Producer.
